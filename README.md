2. How to install
-----------------
To obtain the files in this directory, you can either fork the repository in your own directory or download a zip file to your own machine and extract it. Either way, you should have the unzipped folder on your machine to be able to run it.

You will also need to install the [Google App Engine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) that will containt a few python packages that you will need to run the API:
* protorpc
* endpoints
* webapp2

Once the directory has been downloaded, use your command line tool to navigate to the folder containing the application.

Your folder should contain eleven files and one folder called "Images".

* Design.txt:
* README.md:
* api.py:
* app.yaml:
* cron.yaml:
* game_logic.py:
* game_logic_exploration.py:
